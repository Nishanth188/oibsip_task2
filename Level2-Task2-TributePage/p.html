        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Born in 1869 in Gujarat, India, Gandhi studied law at the Inner Temple in London. After unsuccessfully attempting to practise in India, he moved to South Africa in 1893, where he stayed for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi first used tactics of non-violent resistance to campaign for civil rights.
